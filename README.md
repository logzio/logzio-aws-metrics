# logzio-aws-metrics
**IMPORTANT ⚠️ :** This project should be used by selected beta costumers only

We created this project To simplify shipping prometheus format metrics from cloudwatch.

### Schema
![image info](./util/architecture.jpg)
### Collect cloudwatch metrics
This docker compose uses containers with the following images:
* [otel/opentelemetry-collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector)
* [prom/cloudwatch-exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/cloudwatch-exporter)
* [logzio/config-builder]()

#### How to use:
* Download the `docker-compose.yml` file
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/logzio-aws-metrics/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
```
* Define environment varibales and run `docker-compose up`
```bash
LOGZIO_MODULES="aws" \
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>> \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>> \
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<<AWS_DEFAULT_REGION>> \
LOGZIO_REGION= <<LOGZIO_REGION>> \
LOGZIO_TOKEN=<<LOGZIO_TOKEN>> \
AWS_NAMESPACES=<<AWS_NAMESPACES>> \
SCRAPE_INTERVAL=<<SCRAPE_INTERVAL>> \
P8S_LOGZIO_NAME=<<P8S_LOGZIO_NAME>> \
docker-compose up

```
You'll also need to set up an IAM user
with the permissions to fetch the right metrics,
and the region you're fetching metrics from.

**Note:** extra charges on AWS API requests may be generated by this module.

### Configuration
#### Environment varibales for `logzio/config-builder` container
| Environment varibale | Description |
|---|---|
| AWS_DEFAULT_REGION (Required) | Your region's slug. You can find this in the AWS region menu (in the top menu, to the right). |
| LOGZIO_REGION (Required)| Your Logz.io region code. For example if your region is US, then your region code is `us`. You can find your region code here: https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#regions-and-urls for further information. |
| LOGZIO_MODULES (Required)| Comma-separated list of modules to be enabled on this container (formatted as "module1,module2,module3"). |
| LOGZIO_TOKEN (Required)| Token for shipping metrics to your Logz.io account. |
| SCRAPE_INTERVAL (Required)| The time interval (in seconds) where cloudwatch exporter will retrive metrics from cloudwatch, and opentelemtry collector will scrpae those metrics and send to logz.io.defualts to `300` <br> **Note:** must be a multiple of 60|
| AWS_NAMESPACES (Required) | Comma-separated list of namespaces of the metrics you want to collect. <br> You can find a complete list of namespaces at [_AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html) <br> **Note:** This Environment varibale is required unless you define the `CUSTOM_CONFIG_PATH` Environment varibale |
| P8S_LOGZIO_NAME | value for `p8s_logzio_name` external label, the purpose of this variable is to identify from which Prometheus environment the metrics are arriving to Logz.io. defualts to `logzio-cloudwatch-metrics` |
| CUSTOM_CONFIG_PATH | Path to your cloudwatch exporter configuration file, for more information refer to the [documantation](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter#configuration). <br> **Note:** Set the `period_seconds` parameter according to your `SCRAPE_INTERVAL`|
| CUSTOM_LISTENER | Set a custom URL to ship metrics to (e.g., http://localhost:9200). This overrides the `LOGZIO_REGION` Environment varibale |

#### Environment varibales for `prom/cloudwatch-exporter` container
| Environment varibale | Description |
|---|---|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (Required)| Your IAM user's access key ID. |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (Required)| Your IAM user's secret key. |

#### View services configuration
You can view the configuration in the browser
* Opentelemtry collector: http://localhost:5001/config/otel
* Cloudwatch exporter: http://localhost:5001/config/cloudwatch
#### Help with region configuration

You'll need to specify the AWS region you're collecting metrics from.

![AWS region menu](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/aws/region-menu.png)

Find your region's slug in the region menu
(in the top menu, on the right side).

For example:
The slug for US East (N. Virginia)
is "us-east-1",
and the slug for Canada (Central) is "ca-central-1".
